# Setting up https 

# generate a .crt and .key file using the openssl command:

openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out ironclads-server.crt -keyout ironclads-server.key

# this will generate a new key and crt files named 'ironclads-server'. These two files are read when creating the https server in node

# create the directory /run/secrets and move the .crt and .key files to this directory. This is the directory into which the certs will be injected into
# the running container by the secrets manager. The secrets manager will also inject the production env.js file into /usr/src/app/public.
